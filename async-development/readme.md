You need to implement a weather search:
- create an `index.html` with markup:
    - an input with label
    - a button
    - divs for requested data
    - use your imagination for UI/UX
- create a `style.css` file with styles (try yourself to create a beautiful page), include it into `index.html`
- create an `index.js` file with the next logic:
    - when user clicks a `find` button, user should see the weather from the chosen city
    - you could also include any type of validation (up to you)
