---
- create a branch `todo-app` from `master`;
- create a `todo-app` folder inside your homework's folder (if you are using `create-react-app` do it with `npx` command);
- your `src` folder structure should have `components`, `containers`, `state-management`, `helpers` folders and should look like: ![src folder structure](./assets/src.png)
- the `state-management` folder should contain `actions`, `reducers`, `constants` folders, it also should have an `inex.js` file with combined reducers: ![state-management folder structure](./assets/state-management.png)
- create reusable components in `components` folder;
- create `containers` using `connect()` from `react-redux`;
- your app should have the next requirements: 
    - adding a todo with `Form` component;
    - listing todos under the form;
    - a todo should have a `delete` and toggle `done` buttons;
    - there should be a possibility to render `all` todos, only `done` todos and only `active` todos
