### Improve your weather search from the previous homework
---
![Weather App](./homework.gif)
- add a `My weather` button, clicking it wil interact with `navigator.geolocation` API and fetch weather data of your current location;
- store fetched data at the `localstorage` and render it in a table (use more parameters from a response, not only temperature);
- update value in a table if it was already searched (do not duplicate the city);
- add a `Clear` button to clear all fetched data;
- update your data from a `localstorage` with the newest from the server when access the app;
- use more API features to request your data: choose 5 additional features from the [docs](https://www.apixu.com/doc) and implement it in your app (e.x. forecast weather, search by entered number of days and so on);
